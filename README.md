Audio Classification Using Different types of Machine Learning Classification Algorithm like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Baise. 

For this we use different types of audio-datasets like Urbansound8k, Ravdess, Music generes etc. to classify the audio and find the accuracy of each algorithm by implementing.
